# PRJ2 - Project 2  

The purpose of this repository is to document your Project work.

***Your group is responsible for the repository structure and content***, but we created some template folders for you. You do not need to stick to this.

Currently the structure is as follows:

- [Project Management](/project-management) - Put all project management related stuff in here, e.g. meetings outcomes, retrospectives, screenshots, minutes, planning.
- [Analysis](/analysis) - this is the folder where you should put all analysis artefacts into
- [Design](/design) - this is the folder where you should put all design artefacts into
- [Implementation](/implementation) - this is the folder where you should put all analysis artefacts into

Preferably document with markdown files or AsciiDoc.

***Feel free to adapt the structure***
