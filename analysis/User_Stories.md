# The Sales Officer
##### As a sales officer I would like to be able to register new upcoming flights and start sales for those flights, The system needs to be able to accept temporary price reductions. Discounts can be static for example a 10% discount via code during a certain time. and need to be dynamic for example based on the sun hours at destination the day before the booking is made. Find an source(Api) and feel free to implement that

# The Sales employee
##### As a sales employee I want to lookup available flights and create bookings for my customers for one or more people a specific flight a booking can have paid extra options price needs to be calculated because they are subject to change. We are working in a team with multiple people selling flights at the same time so your system needs to be able to coop with that(Potentially booking the same seats at the same time)
